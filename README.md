## Overview and fork description
This program can bring the macOS-style three-finger dragging functionality to Windows computers, to select text or perform other selecting operations.

You can also optionally implement middle-button dragging using four fingers.

Forked from [ClementGre/ThreeFingersDragOnWindows](https://github.com/ClementGre/ThreeFingersDragOnWindows), and mainly adds support for four-finger middle-button dragging on its basis, out of the need for middle-button dragging as a commonly used view rotation operation in many programs, especially games and 3D software.

Thanks to the original author for bringing such a good software.

## Installation

Download the zip package from [Github Release](https://github.com/jackzzs/FourFingersDragOnWindows/releases) and run `FourFingersDragOnWindows.exe`.

You may need to have the Windows App SDK redistributable installed. You can download it from this page: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/downloads](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/downloads).

The program will start minimizd and you can show the settings panel from the taskbar icon.

You can enable the `Run at Startup` option from the `Other Settings` page of the settings panel.

## How to use

Make sure to disable the "Tap twice and drag to multi-select" behaviour and all of the defaults 3-finger and 4-finger swipe behaviour via ``Touchpad settings`` in windows preferences for the drag to work without interferences.

To open the configuration pane, click the FourFingersDragOnWindows tray icon on the Windows task bar.
